# game 2048

In this layout, I implemented the classic game of 2048 using JavaScript. The game features a 4x4 grid where players can move cells using keyboard arrow keys. Additionally, the game is optimized for mobile devices, allowing users to enjoy gameplay through swipe gestures. This makes the game convenient for players using various types of devices and enhances the overall gaming experience.
The objective is to merge cells with the same numbers to create larger numbers, with the ultimate goal of reaching the elusive 2048 tile.

The game follows the standard rules of 2048, including merging cells, adding new tiles after each move, and displaying win or game over messages accordingly. The score increases with each move, with the score being incremented by the sum of all merged cells.

The project is divided into two main parts: the game logic written on JS, and the game UI implemented in HTML and SCSS. The UI dynamically updates based on the game state, providing a seamless and engaging user experience.
